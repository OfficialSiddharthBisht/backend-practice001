# backend-practice001

## Objective:
Create a Node.js application with MongoDB integration to manage products and their
associated reviews. The application should consist of two models: Product and Review. 
The Product model includes attributes such as name, price, creation date (cDate),
update date (uDate), and a unique identifier (_id). The Review model includes userId, 
description, creation date (cDate), update date (uDate), and a unique identifier (_id).
Implement API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on products and reviews, 
including virtual population of reviews for a product.

## Features:

## Product Model:

Attributes: Name, Price, cDate, uDate, _id.
Implement functionality to add, read all, read by ID, update, and delete products.

## Review Model:

Attributes: userId, description, cDate, uDate, _id.
Implement functionality to add and delete reviews.
API Endpoints:

Create RESTful API endpoints for the following operations:
Add a Product (POST /api/products)
Read All Products (GET /api/products)
Read Product by ID (GET /api/products/:id)
Update a Product (PUT /api/products/:id)
Delete a Product (DELETE /api/products/:id)
Create a Review for a Product (POST /api/products/:productId/reviews)
Delete a Review (DELETE /api/products/:productId/reviews/:reviewId)
Virtual Population of Reviews for a Product (GET /api/products/:productId/reviews)
Technical Requirements:

## Node.js Backend:

Use Node.js to create a backend server for handling product and review-related functionalities.
MongoDB Integration:

Integrate MongoDB as the backend database to persist product and review data.
Define appropriate MongoDB schemas for the Product and Review models.
Express.js:

Utilize Express.js to build RESTful API endpoints for managing products and reviews.
Mongoose:

Use Mongoose or another suitable library to interact with MongoDB and facilitate model creation, validation, and queries.
Data Persistence:

Ensure that data is effectively stored and retrieved from MongoDB.
Sample Request and Response:

json
Copy code
// Sample Product Object
{
  "name": "Product A",
  "price": 29.99
}

// Sample Review Object
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "description": "This product is great!"
}

// Sample API Response (GET /api/products/:id)
{
  "_id": "1234567890",
  "name": "Product A",
  "price": 29.99,
  "cDate": "2023/10/12/15/30/45",
  "uDate": "2023/10/12/15/30/45",
  "reviews": [
    {
      "_id": "abcdefghij",
      "userId": "user123",
      "description": "This product is great!",
      "cDate": "2023/10/12/15/35/20",
      "uDate": "2023/10/12/15/35/20"
    }
  ]
}
Additional Considerations:

## Error Handling:

Implement proper error handling for scenarios such as failed CRUD operations or data retrieval issues.
Testing:

Implement unit tests to validate the functionality of key components, including product and review management.
Documentation:

Provide clear documentation for setting up the project, running the application, and any other relevant details.
Code Comments:

Add comments in the code to explain complex logic or any crucial implementation details.
User Notifications:

Consider incorporating user-friendly notifications for successful operations or other relevant interactions.
Delivery:
Submit the Node.js codebase along with any necessary setup instructions, database schema, and documentation. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to build a robust and functional Node.js application for managing products and reviews with MongoDB integration.
